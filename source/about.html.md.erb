### Mission

We are experiencing a global antibiotic resistance crisis, and we require alternative measures to treat patients unable to combat bacterial infections. Data collected by researchers around the world are stacking up in favour of a place for phage therapy in modern medicine.

Although dozens of labs around the world routinely cultivate phages against most bacterial pathogens currently faced by patients, many challenges hinder the efficient distribution of phages to patients in times of need.

By generating and maintaining an open public directory of researchers willing and able to test and mass-produce phages in response to a critically ill patientâ€™s need, we can connect physicians, patients and families with potentially life-saving cures to otherwise untreatable drug-resistant infections.


### Background

Articles, drug-resistant super bugs, TED talk, buzzfeed article, the tweet, etc.

  I am a Microbiology and Biotechnology PhD student at the University of Alberta studying the interactions between bacteriophage receptor binding proteins and bacterial carbohydrates. 

  While I am a graduate student of the University of Alberta, I currently work in Dr. Christine Szymanski's glycobiology lab at the Complex Carbohydrate Research Centre at the University of Georgia as an Exchange Scholar.
