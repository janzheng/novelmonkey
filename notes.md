Novelmonkey 3 (vue) Notes




# Header


## Todo

- add a background color to wordcounter and renderer menu, hard to see esp. in dark mode
- hovering mouse over renderer should show menu, even under focus
- airtable Q&A box? maybe just email for now
- scroll smooth doesn't work for a lot of browsers, maybe still need scrollto
- dynamic icons based on current mood color

## Design

- {Session} is a writing session (many paragraphs over a day)
  - can be used for reporting; when editing not so useful anymore
  - one session contains many writing fragments
  - [Fragments]
  - metrics
  - project (purely for writing metrics, a project should use fragments for data)
  - tied to user

- {Fragment} is a movable piece of writing
  - timestamp (timestamp is used as unique ID)
  - text
  - tags (#plot; indexed for search)
  - refs (@person; indexed for search)
  - project (can be assigned project IDs, ex 'novel-1')
  - tied to user

- Project
  - a way to organize sessions and fragments (v3.2, future version)
  - tied to user



## Next





## Future

- calm writing app additions (sounds, visuals, games)
- livestream writing
- writing competitions (either just show metrics / like racing game) or actually see what they're writing
- iA-writer & novlr features
  - folders, different writings
  - connect to dropbox?
  - server ($3/mo or $30/yr) for persistence across devices
