## Todo

- phage system (replicate current)
- news suggestion
  - twitter, email, link, title, text

## Planning

- Structure
  - Home
  - Alerts
    - alert service
    - all the tiny letter alerts should be written here, along with sent out through twitter, email, etc.
    - 'alerts/:slug'
  - Join '/join'
    - Options to 'join the fight'
    - as researchers, doctors, or public
    - '/join/public'
      - for public education and newsletter
    - '/join/therapy' / Join/doctors
      - Information for doctors, how they can use
      - Directory of doctors that are interested in phage therapy / party of phage directory network
      - Also info for nurses, etc. but geared towards ID and family doctors
    - '/join/research'
      - for labs with phages
      - add phage form
  - Newsletter (needs better name â€” 'viral'?)
    - combined w/ Phage Directory blog
      - *** the problem is that we really still do need a place to say our things
            but if they were split up, there'd be too many places
    - the gist: summary of health + research + pharmacology, from a public's perspective
    - names: viral, the path (pathogen), 
      - health, microbiology, treatments, disease, infections, reveal, remedy, scratch (opposite word?), the streak, (medium, method, the drip, trickle, the flow, the stream), hex, the loop, moment, veracity, sincerity, truth, veritas, message/note/memo/missive; powerthesaurus.org
      - basic / basicc.org / thebasic.pub
      - whether.pub
      - moment, instant, juncture
      - the span / spann, realm
      - grok, grokk, grasp, the grasp
      - the angst,
      - cover, coverage, 
      - clarify
      - distil, vapor, clarify, refine, purify, express, pure, form
      - relief, gather, the dig, the take, 
      - peruse
      - the gist
      - outlier
      - outcome
      - together (we are in this together), tandem, 
      - gatekeeper 
      - wearebig (re: Mallory's story)
        - wearehere, here, 
      - should be inclusive or hinting to all these things, but still be vague enough
      - e.g. like the Verge about tech and society, implying cutting edge
      - "2050"? as in, ETA or countdown to year 2050 of antibiotic resistance?
    - microbials
    - microbiome
    - antibiotic resistance
    - phage therapy
    - phage research / links
    - pathogens
    - treatments for bacteria-related diseases, infections
    - clinical trial updates
    - treatment-centric technology
    - phage / phage-related tech (phages, lysins, pharmacology, etc.)
    - insurance 
    - pharma
    - drugs
  - Site Policies '/policies'
  - Directory '/' 
    - the entry points should be the main site; if that's impossible then
      use something like '/main'
    - Phages '/phages'
      - directory filtered by phages
    - Hosts (phage hosts) '/hosts'
      - directory filtered by phage hosts, bacteria
    - Diseases '/diseases'
      - infectious disease profile and news
      - relationship with hosts, and phages
    - Antibiotics '/antibiotics'
      - list of antibiotics and resistance;
      - what phages can interact w/ hosts for this antibiotic
    - Organizations (orgs) '/orgs'
    - Labs '/labs'
      - subset of organizations
    - People '/people'
  - Terms / Glossary / Definitions
    - definitions, explanations
  - Feedback
    - specifically set up for the drop cards about ideas
  - Ask
    - *** superceded by drift
    - ask us questions? / post a question etc.


## Done

- add ATLX forms thing to Feedback page
- add Webtask system for sending feedback into PhDir Input; secure layer
- create a writer@zeee.co account to write to the input (just cytosis@zeee.co)
