Novelmonkey 3 (vue) Notes




# Header


## Todo

- airtable Q&A box? maybe just email for now
- scroll smooth doesn't work for a lot of browsers, maybe still need scrollto

## Design

- {Session} is a writing session (many paragraphs over a day)
  - can be used for reporting; when editing not so useful anymore
  - one session contains many writing fragments
  - [Fragments]
  - metrics
  - project (purely for writing metrics, a project should use fragments for data)
  - tied to user

- {Fragment} is a movable piece of writing
  - timestamp (timestamp is used as unique ID)
  - text
  - tags (#plot; indexed for search)
  - refs (@person; indexed for search)
  - project (can be assigned project IDs, ex 'novel-1')
  - tied to user

- Project
  - a way to organize sessions and fragments (v3.2, future version)
  - tied to user
