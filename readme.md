# Phage Directory

This is the Phage Directory core project. Built on Vue/Nuxt





## Build Setup

Don't forget to use a newer npm: `nvm use 8.11.2`

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
